## 🔎 What is it?

Allay Wormhole is a Discord bot that allow the connect textual channels together, even between different servers!

Allay Wormhole, such as other Allay projects, is free and open-source. It is written in Python and uses the Discord.py library and is managed by the [Gunivers](https://gunivers.net) community.

🚀 Connect your channels!
```

## 🏃 Motivation

Many discord communities either have multiple server, either would like to have more interaction with other friendly communities. However, Discord doesn't provide any way to connect channels between servers. This is where Allay Wormhole comes in!
